## Running locally

We don't yet have parallelshell working on windows, so in separate terminals run:

```
npm run watch-css
```
and

```
npm run start
```

## Deploying to dev

git push to master.  Too easy.  

[Dev is here]( https://master.dc92gzvp0zb9i.amplifyapp.com)

## Documentation and User Stories

The main documentation for this project is in the doc directory as ReStructuredText (.rst files).  There you can use:

```
make html
```
