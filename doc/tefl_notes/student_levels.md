# Student Levels

We’ve shown you what the seven student levels are, but it’s time to go into a little more depth about what each level actually entails.

In each of the boxes below you’ll see what typically identifies a student at that level of ability, in terms of what they can do, and what they will be learning at that stage.

Hopefully this will help you understand how to identify a student’s level and how to prepare lesson plans to help them progress.

Click on the level to find out what the students can do and what they should be learning:

## Beginner

What they can do

Students’ knowledge at this level will range from knowing absolutely nothing to having picked up a few words or phrases (i.e. a False Beginner student). They will have no knowledge of how to structure the language correctly.

What they should learn

Personal basic information and introductions (name, age, family)
Colours
Numbers 1-100
Asking about names and jobs
Yes/no questions and short answers
Present simple
Telling the time
Useful classroom language e.g. “I haven’t got a pen”.
Pronunciation: Consonant clusters and other problematic areas – these are taught at all levels, but are essential at Beginner level.

## Elementary 
What they can do

They are improving quickly, getting to grips with basic tenses and able to communicate simply about general topics. There will still be lots of errors though, and new tenses and forms will require a lot of consolidation.

What they should learn

The verb “to be” (am, is, are)
Basic common adjectives
Personal pronouns
Possessive adjectives
Present Simple
Articles (the, a/an)
I like/don’t like + nouns/-ing forms

Comparatives and superlatives
Adverbs of frequency
“Wh” questions
Present Continuous for future
Prepositions of time and place
Auxiliary verbs: be and do

## Lower Intermediate (or "Pre-Intermediate")

What they can do

Students at this level are growing in confidence with their tenses and are now learning lots of vocabulary, phrases and functions (what a word or phrase is used for and why).

What they should learn

Past simple irregular verbs
Future simple
Future with going to
Past continuous
Auxiliary verbs: have and had
Zero Conditional
First Conditional
Present perfect simple
For, Since and Ago
Should, May, Might, Have to, Must (modal verbs)

## Intermediate
What they can do

Students at this level are keen to use English, but not quite fluent yet. They have a good knowledge of grammar, but need to consolidate it further. Vocabulary is also strong here.

Students often feel they are stagnating at this stage, with lots of time spent on consolidating learning before moving on further, which can be frustrating for some.

What they should learn

Transitive and intransitive verbs
Present perfect continuous
Unless
Second Conditional
Passive present and past
Past perfect simple
Past perfect continuous
Gerund or infinitive
Relative clauses and relative pronouns
Verbs + preposition
Causative “have sth done”
Despite/in spite of
Stop to /stop doing

## Upper Intermediate (or Post-Intermediate)
What they can do

Students’ English levels here are high and they should be able to communicate on a wide range of topics. There will still be mistakes though, particularly with use of idioms, phrasal verbs, etc.

What they should learn

Third Conditional
Mixed Conditionals
Wishes and regrets
Reported speech
Future Continuous
Future perfect simple
Future perfect continuous
Impersonal passives
Prepositional phrases
Would/used to

## Advanced
What they can do

Students make fewer mistakes than at the post-intermediate stage and use the language confidently. They should have no problems studying at an English-speaking university.

What they should learn

Developing speaking, writing, reading and listening skills
Grammar consolidation
Improving and expanding idiomatic expressions and phrasal verbs

## Profiicency
What they can do

Students at this level are as close to a native speaker as a student can get, and some may have spent some time living in a native English speaking country or environment. There should be little accent and near perfect use of the language. This level is often required for academic purposes, though it should be sufficient for most employment.

What they should learn

Perfecting writing, reading, listening and speaking skills (particularly accent)
Perfecting understanding of idioms, phrasal verbs and natural fluency
