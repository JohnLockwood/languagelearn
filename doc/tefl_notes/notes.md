# TEFL Course notes

# Grammar Course:


Good teaching demo (InflectionRulesPresentAndPast.mp4) on inflection rules - see also [this page on infletions](http://esl.fis.edu/grammar/rules/inflections.htm)

Past tense sounds

played, loved smiled (D sound)
Introduced, walked, talked, watched (T sound)
Intended, printed, imitated (ed)

D           T       id
stayed      hoped   waited
toyed       coped   avoided
shoved      looked  mated
learned     cooked  sounded

past participles - can be irregular
for regular verbs same as simple past
Present participle is "-ing" form.  Describe an ongoing action.  Used in present or past continuous tenses.

Auxiliary verbs are be, have, do.

Modal verbs:  can, could, shall, should, will, would, may, might, must, ought to, used to

* Have no infinitive
* Have no past tense, no present participle, or past participle
* Can't stand alone as main verbs

Most common are:  can, must, will

Words can look like verbs but be used as an adjective, adverb, or noun.

Three types:

* Gerunds -- looks like a present participle, reading, driving, swimming, etc.  If used in a sentence as a noun, becomes a gerund.  "Bob is riding a horse" (participle, present continuous) vs "Riding is an expensive hobby" (Gerund - riding is a noun here - gerund)
* Participles
* Infinitives

Some verbs take a gerund only, some infinitive only, some either.  Some either but change meaning:

https://www.thoughtco.com/verbs-gerund-infinitive-that-change-meaning-1209884

To teach this need a lot of examples.

Adjectives often come before a noun, "delicious meal" etc.  But they can come following a verb about senses and perception:

be	feel	taste
look	sound	smell
appear	seem

Ordering adjectives when using several at same time:

They go in this order:  Opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, use.

Adverbs of frequency (daily, hourly, often, frequently, rarely, occasionally, always, etc.) takes at least one whole lesson, maybe more.

Rules for comparative adjectives (copied from course:)

    Adjectives or adverbs with ONE syllable take -er. (Except for fun, bad and good e.g which are irregular.)
    warmer / colder / hotter / wilder /safer, etc.
    For c-v-c, need to double the final consonant, e.g., above hot --> hotter, big -> bigger etc.

    Adjectives and adverbs with TWO syllables ending in -y and some other random TWO syllable words, also take -er.
    friendlier / prettier / lovelier / narrower / simpler / quieter / cleverer

    Other TWO syllable words take more and not -er as do adjectives longer than TWO syllables.
    more modern /more ancient / more tiring / more boring / more expensive / more beautiful / more comfortable

Very similar to superlative rule, but with est.

Short class -- Definite article -- leave out the "The" when making a general statement.  Use the to refer to a specific thing if everyone knows what we're talking about.  Some as plural of "a"

Determiners is more general, includes words that tell us what something is...
    * Articles (a/an, the)
    * Possessives (my, your his, whose, their, etc)
    * Demonstratives (this, these, that, those)

...or HOW MANY things we're talking about:
    * Some, any, no
    * Each, every, either, neither
    * Much, many, more, most
    * All, both

* Reported speech (Intermediate or advanced level.)  Change elements of sentence, e.g.  Interesting

"I want to learn about" --> "HE said HE wantED to learn about..."  Present simple tense -> past tense version of same thing.  Needs a reporting verb too, said.

"I am studying" -> "She said she was studying"  So present continuous -> past continuous.

"said" most common, "exclaimed", tell, ask demand, advise, promise.

"We will win" -> "They promised they would win"  (Will -> would)

But DON'T change the tense of the verb if it's always true, "The sun rises in the East." -> "He said the sun rises in the East."

"Do you know anything about ..." -> "She ASKED if/whether I knew anything".  So pronoun, if, and present -> past.

Common problem for students is imperative.  In that case we use infinitive, not past tense, so:

"Eat something" -> "She told me TO EAT something"

"Do not put that on your plate" -> "He told me NOT TO PUT IT on my plate".  That became it.

# Simple present

    1) talk about habits and routines, "Anne walks in the park every day" 

    2) "Show something is true in the present.  I live in Chicago.

    3) Facts and truths.  "Water freezes at zero degrees celsius".  "Do you know how to cook?" (Last could be in last category)

    4) Fixed future events with a near future word.  "I fly to Shanghai tomorrow" (he flies -- show how it changes.)

Note course has a fill-in quiz type that would be easy to do.  Where fill-in is done with HTML select control.

Regular verbs add S in to 3rd person singular.  Verbs ending in y -> ie, for example, cries, tries, fries.  
From lesson 'If we are using a verb that ends in “o”, “s”, “z”, “ch”, “x” or “sh” we add “es” like so: goes, watches, does, buzzes etc.'

Affirmative / Negative / Interogative - "he doesn't play", "Does he play" -- in that case verb doesn't change.

# Present Continuous or Present Progressive

1) A temporary action happening right now.  It may also continue into the near future.  e.g. "Irene is walking to the park now."

We use the verb "be" plus a present participle to form present continuous tense.  Two correct negative forms:

Alicia isn't working today or Alicia's not working today.  (Except for "I am")

1) We use for something happening right now, "Ed is just leaving the office"

2) Also for something we want to show is temporary, "Lana is studying history"

3) A future arranged or planned event, "I am going to a new school next year."

4) Something happens repeatedly, we use it to show annoyance, a lot of times with always, like "It's always raining in Charlotte"  (weak)

# Simple past

Something that happened in the past and is now finished. Usually means we can say when it happened.  E.g. Luz walked to the park yesterday afternoon.

Lots of irregular verbs.  Also the negative is hard. The only one that changes form in the past depending on the pronoun is to be "I/he/she/it was" "You/we/they were" 

Regular verbs add "ed" Live talk want -> Lived, taked, wanted.  But irregular eat -> ate, speak -> spoke, have -> had.  Not many rules about past tense irregular verbs.

Pronounciation 
played /d/
talked /t/
wanted /id/

Spelling:

Ends in e just add d -> closed
c-v-c repeat final consonant -> shopped
ends in y after a consonant  carry -> carried

## DANGER ZONE :) 

Negative statement or question except for verb to be, use past tense form of to do plus infinitive

I didn't go to the store.
He did not take the test

And then the teacher in the TEFL class totally glossed over how much drilling is needed.
Question: 

Did you...?

Usages:

* Completed past actions.  "I went to Colombia in 2010"
* Past habits and routines "I played basedball when I was younger"
* Something that was true for a period of time, but completed:  "He smoked in college" "She lived in France for two years".

Common problems:

* Pronunciation
* Forgetting to use past tense form
* Negatives and questions.

# Past continuous or past progressive

* Something that happened in the past over a period of time.  Oscar was walking in the past when he saw Anne.

* Was / were plus present participle -- again "I/he/she/it was" "You/we/they were"

I                               |
He/she/it                       |     was
------------------------------- | --------------        + verb + ing.
We/They/You                          were    

Question:

Were you going?
Was I working?  etc.

Uses
* Action in progress in past 

Good timeline example is The sun was shining when the policeman knocked loudly on the door.  Good exercise is story telling like this.

Use #2 is simultaneous action in past I was singing while the dog was barking.

Use #3 interrupted action  "I was singing when I heard a knock on the door."  Continuous only for action that's going to be interrupted.

Use #4 - Action in progress at a certain time.  "It wasn't me who killed her.  I was working in my office at 4:00 PM."

Common problem is using this instead of past simple:

BAD: "When I was six I was walking to school".  That happened all the time in the past during that year, so past simple.

# Present Perfect Simple
Note, Need to consolidate uses based on PresentPerfectSimpleUses.mp4
* "a tense that students really find tricky"
* Doesn't exist in all languages.
## Uses:
* Something that happened in the past but at no specific point in time.  I have been to Colombia vs past simple I went to Colombia in 2010.
* Something that happened in the past and could be repeated.  "I have gone back to Rhode Island many times".  Vs I went to RI -- not repeated.
* When action starts in past and is still happening.
* Something appened recently and could impact the present "Anne has walked to past in last week."
* Past action that's true now.  "Juan has lived in Spain for six years."  If past simple, "He lived in Spain for six years", suggests it's done.


Uses (from another slides)

1. This tense can be used to link past events or actions with present effects or results, for example: "Alicja has tidied up the room". The emphasis here is on the result, as we can see the room is now tidy.  Or "I can't travel I HAVE LOST my passport."
2. We can use it to talk about an event that has recently stopped – "Ollie has cooked dinner".  "I've just returned from China".  Note use of CONTRACTION here.
3. We can use it for a completed action that has an effect on the present – "Anne has lost her wallet" (so she needs to find it).
4. We can also use it to talk about “past experience” events at non-specific times in the past, as in the example we used above: "I have eaten octopus". We don’t know when they ate the octopus, nor how many times they have eaten it, just that it has happened.

It’s the auxiliary verb have which is in its present form in the sentence, which is why we call it present perfect (past perfect is a separate tense and uses the auxiliary in its past form – had).

Common problems:

* Careful of "has gone" vs "has been" somewhere.  First one implies still there, second one implies you came back.
* Using present perfect with time references.  Always use past simple if did something at a specific time.

Negative is usually haven't / hasn't

Demo game he did was with two teams filling out past simple/participle (as a race)

        Simple  Participle
Buy 
Fly
Eat
Drink
Write
Read
Leave
Have
Go
Be
Tidy
Pack
Sleep

-- Could add
Put
Find
Ride

Did some too with easy examples:

Wrong sentences correting.

# Present Perfect Continuous

Happened in past but continues into present.

Similar to present perfect simple, but use it to focus on duration, e.g.

Rhonda has been cooking all afternoon
We have been living here for five years

Structure:  Have / has + been + present participle

1) Uses - emphasize the action
I have been reading the book you recommended.

2) Emphasize period of time
I have been reading for three hours.

3) Emphasis on temporary
I have been reading a lot lately.

4) Emphasize the result, whether finished or not
I have been baking a cake.
I have been working on creating a course in English.

# Past Perfect Simple -- Happened in the past and was completed BEFORE another action or event took place.

Jeff had ridden his bike 25 miles or more every day before riding a 100-mile race.

Anne had eaten at that restaurant many times and was surprised to learn it had bad reviews.

Usage:

Event before another action "I had just picked up my ukelele when she walked in."

Show evidence of a past action:

"I had learnt four new songs and my fingers were sore."

Emphasize permanent states:  "I had played guitar before I started learning ukelele."  (This looks like first one)

4. Emphasize completion
"I had played two songs before she left".

Common problem:

(WRONG)  The Greeks had invented democracy.  [Students will make this mistake for something that happened a long time ago].  Simple past would work here.

# Past Perfect Continuous

Subject + have / had + been + present participle

Action continuing in the past but before another action:

"She had already been living in the US for five years when she got her citizenship".

Uses:

1) Emphasizes action that happened over a period of time:  "I had been playing for three hours before she told me to stop."

2) Show results of previous action with focus on activity, "I had been typing for two hours so my hands were sore."

Common problem is knowing how to use it.  Just need practice, perhaps with music or some activity, and mix in past simple, highlight different things.

# Future Simple

Will / will not / won't + infinitive for - "to".  Will is a modal verb.

Ordering in restaurant is good example.  "I will have..."

Good to explore will as a modal verb:

* Will you help me?   (Polite request)
* Shall I light the fire  (Offer)
* I'll make sure the fire is blazing  (Promise)
* He'll be 28 next year  (A "certainty")
* I think the rain will stop soon. (Prediction / guess)

Common problem is time phrases, like a double future, using

When you will return, I will give you a towel  -> should be "When you return, I will give you a towel."

Overuse:  I will play a gig tonight.  Correct, but can say "I am playing a gig tonight" or "I'm going to play a gig tonight"

## Future with going to:

Future with "going to":  

Usually taught at same time as "will" Subject + "to be" [am/is/are], "going to" +  infinitive w/o to

Uses:

Show plans or intentions "I am going to visit Spain next year".

Compare "I think I'll have pizza." to "I'm going to have pizza".

Prediction based on evidence.  "Look at those clouds.  It's going to rain."

# Advanced Tenses (for higher level students):

# Future Continuous

Will + be + verb + ing

1) Something that will be happening at some point in the future

* She'll be arriving at 8 PM
* We'll be living in Colombia by this time next year.

2) To show simultaneous action:

* When you arrive tomorrow, he'll be playing piano and she will be dancing.

Problems:

* Is complex.  Give students a clear context food / travelling, etc.  and timeline.

# Future perfect simple

Not that common.  Best to start students with examples

Form is will + have / had + past participle

Uses: 

To show action will be completed by a certain time

Examples:

By the end of the day, Jack will have written three chapters of his new book.
By this time next year, you will have mastered English.
I will have built a house by lunch tomorrow.

To show a deduction or prediction about the present (definitely more advanced):

"They'll have used up all the water by now."

Most common problem students have is using the second action instead of first for future perfect simple:

Example (BAD):  "I'll run out of run out of legos before we will have finished."  Not quite as clear

Corrected:  "I will have finished before we run out of legos."  Future perfect simple at beginning.

# Future perfect continuous

Something temporary with a duration that will happen by a specific time. Action in future continuing up to a specific time.

E.g. "Anne will have been walking to the park for 15 minutes when she arrives."

Form is will / won't + have + been + present participle

Common problem is can be confused with future continuous.  Can do it on timeline


# Conditionals (last part of exam)

* Simplest are with "if":  E.g. If it doesn't rain, we'll go to the park.
* Can also use unless sometimes:  "We'll go to the park unless it rains."
* So long as or providing.   "Alicja’s dog can play in the lounge as long as/so long as it doesn’t make any mess. "Ollie can get a discount on the trains providing he has his young person’s discount card."
* Or or otherwise "Anne’s students have got to start studying, or/otherwise they’ll fail their exams." (This means the same as: If Ann’s students don’t start studying, they will fail their exams).
* Had + subject + verb (formal) "Had she known Jack was waiting outside, Alicja would have invited him to come in."

## Zero conditional

* For things that are generally true.
* Present simple to present simple.
"If you push that button, the lamp turns on."
"If Robert arrives late for work, his boss gets mad."

## First conditional

About something possible / probable / likely to happen but not a certainty
"If it rains, I will stay at home"
"If Jack works late, he'll get paid overtime."
"If you keep going to the gym, you'll get much fitter."
Present Simple -> Future Simple.



## Second conditionals
To talk about unlikely but not impossible conditions.

If I won the lottery, I would buy a Ferrari.

Condition (past simple) + Result (would / could / might + root of infinitive)

Examples are fun here:

If you had any job in the world...	If you met anybody, living or dead...	If you chose between a long, healthy life or a short, incredibly rich one...
If you lost one of your senses...	If you changed one thing about the city you live in...	If you were trapped on a desert island...
If you ate one type of food for every meal for the rest of your life...	If you chose to be very physically attractive or very intelligent...	If you lived anywhere...

Note: What might be hard is contracted form

I'd
He'd
We'd 
etc for "would

## Third conditionals

To report a hypothetical condition that didn't happen in past and is now impossible.

"If I had studied more,I would have passed the final."

Condition (past perfect simple) + Result (would/could/might + present perfect simple [have + past participle]

If Alicja hadn’t moved to Costa Rica, she would have returned to Poland.
If Alicja had gone to the party, she would have met some interesting people.
If Jack hadn’t become an English teacher, he would have stayed in his job in IT.
If Anne hadn’t retired, she couldn’t have moved to Vietnam.
If Ollie hadn’t given up football, he might have become a great player!

# Mixed conditionals

These look like just review of the four above -- but talked about treating them with students as one subject (makes sense), within the context of one subject matter (travel, education, whatever).

No, then she mixed them e.g. If I had worked hard at school, I would be able to find a job (3rd conditional plus second conditional).

If I were rich (2nd - present), I would have gone to greece (2nd)

If I had worked hard at school (3rd), I would be going to college tomorrow (2nd -- future).

This is ADVANCED.  


# Methodology Course:

9 Roles a teacher might have to play.

* Controller.
* Organizer
* Assessor
* Elicitor
* Participant
* Tutor
* Resource
* Observer
* Facilitator


# Lesson Plan Structures

## PPP - Presentation / Practice / Production 

* Stands for the key stages of lesson
* Good for new teachers
* Good for going from controlled exercises to free practice

Stages in lesson should look like:

Lead-In (5%)  Warm up, introduction
Presentation 10-30% Teacher teaches meaning, pronunciation, form of target language
Practice 20-30% Practice - students practice
Production 30-50% - Free activities led by students.

## Second Type is ESA

* Engage
* Study
* Activate

Similar to PPP but allows you to go backward and forward between stages if needed.

Used for vocabulary and grammar lessons.

Allows for lots of Eliciting -- so creates high levels of ...

STT (Student Talking Time)

Engage gets students interested.  Use games, discussions, music, pictures, stories, etc.

Study:  Focus on language and how constructed.  Here use eliciting questions / tasks, group and pair work, texts to study vocab or speaking styles.

# Activities
Songs, games, etc.

4 diff games 
Blackboard race - 2 teams, divide board in half, students need to run to board and write a word on a topic, for example, irregular past tense verbs
Tic tac toe - each square of board has infinitive for example, each team gets time to confer in group, create correct second conditional sentence.  Get it right, score the square.  If not, lose the square.
Hot potato - using a soft ball or soft toy. Verb forms, or full sentences using comparatives.
Sentence matching game - everyone gets a card, with subject, verb, phrase.  walk around, have to find some folks to make sentences.  Controlled if sentences fixed, free if used prompts to make up sentences themselves

Stories:

* Chain stories, each student adds to it.  E.g. conjunctions on board, I went shopping, students fill in details.
* Chain stories in past simple tense.  In demo, not much prompting, just started it off.
* Choose a character and describe them.

# 5 things that contribute to my presenting skills

* Good voice projection / sound.
* Good skills overall (toastmasters)
* Humor
* Ability to prepare (keeping it simple hard).
* Task focus.

Things that could have gone on there.
* Eye contact
* Gestures and facial expression
* Voice projection
* Movement
* Watch the TTT
* Build rapport.

Visual aids:

* Board
* Flash cards (can also expand from one card to related topics, e.g. Train -> Station -> Ticket)
* Realia (props)
* Overhead projector

4 vocab things you need (exercise)

* Meaning
* Pronunciation
* Practice
* Form
* Practice in context
* Generating new sentences with it (production / use)

Why listening and reading are hard (Excercise)
* To me listening especially hard.
* Uses vocabulary you don't yet know often
* Native speakers can go faster than I can process it
* Expect it to be easy as it is in English and it's not
* Unlike reading, hard to "re-scan it" w/o cooperation of other person.


### Video Observation Course

Used to lesson 1:

"Stand up" (gestures)  Game, word to describe yourself

Presentation:  Eliciting language, hair color changed picture.  How do we say it change?  Can you think of a way to say it?  First was "Her hair was.." Second was "she used to have".  Let students guess.

Bad one - stomped on student answers, lead-in was rushed and pro-forma.  

Presentation stage very confusing language.  Get your books?  Focus on lack of books very negative.  Looking at board.  Ignoring student questions. 
Students still don't have books.

Second unit, bad one first, no lead-in.  The examples in "practice stage" were unclear and didn't elicit the target language, were yes/no questions rather than going for "I agree", "I don't agree".  Arguing with students.  Condescending.

Good one had good warm up exercise on best smart phone, good practice on sorting expressions

# Skill lesson 

* Lead in, something, and pre-teach vocabulary.  Eliciting, pair work to guess meaning.  Followed by presentation.  Then students describe ingredients for a dish from their country.
* Reading for gist and detail.  Questions about the reading, go over questions.
* Follow up.  Ask about Twitter, and asked about Twitter, what's this #, etc.  Asked students to write a tweet. Gave out strips of paper with twitter bird to write on.  Then for homework, write advice to friend about what you should or shouldn't do here.54
